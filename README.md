The model has undergone training using an augmented image dataset derived from the video game Halo Infinite. The dataset comprises screenshots from an online gameplay session. Specifically designed for object detection, the labels denote entities as "enemy" and "enemy-head," which is inherently self-explanatory. The training involves batches of 16 and spans 8 epochs. The outcomes are presented below.
